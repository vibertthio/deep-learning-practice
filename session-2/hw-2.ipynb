    "Choosing between these is often a matter of trial and error. Though you can make some insights depending on your normalization scheme. For instance, if your output is expected to be in the range of 0 to 1, you may not want to use a tanh function, which ranges from -1 to 1, but likely would want to use a sigmoid. Keep the ranges of these activation functions in mind when designing your network, especially the final output layer of your network."
